FriendFinder

Users submits their name, a link to their picture, and answers 10 survey questions as it most pertains to them.  Their response will be recorded as a JSON on the site and they'll be shown who best matches their responses!

Users will be able find a friend with similar interests/outlooks and other users will be able to match up with them as well.
